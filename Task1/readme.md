# Task

Calculate the area of triangle with sides a = 4.5, b = 5.9 and c = 9.

Print calculated value with precision = 2

# Task Execution

I created a function triangle_area(a,b,c) which takes 3 arguments (the sides of the triangle).

When executing main.py script we can input any values from command line prompt. Then the script executes the function and the result is printed out with the precision of 2 decimal points as required.

## Answer

The area of the triangle is 11.58

## Usage

```bash
main.py
```
